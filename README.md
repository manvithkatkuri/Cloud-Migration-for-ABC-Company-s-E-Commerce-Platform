# Cloud Migration for ABC Companyâ€™s E-Commerce Platform

This project outlines a comprehensive cloud architecture solution to support the migration of ABC Company's e-commerce platform to a scalable, secure, and high-performance cloud environment using AWS. The design incorporates compute, storage, networking, and database components with features like elasticity, redundancy, and cost-efficiency.

## Objectives

1. **Cloud Migration Goals**:
   - Ensure robust **data security** and compliance with industry standards.
   - Achieve seamless **scalability** to handle peak traffic periods.
   - Minimize service interruptions through high availability and redundancy.

2. **Technical Implementation**:
   - Design a cloud-based architecture leveraging AWS services such as EC2, RDS, ElastiCache, and VPC.
   - Integrate load balancing and auto-scaling to manage variable workloads dynamically.
   - Optimize operational costs while maintaining performance.

3. **Regional Cost Analysis**:
   - Compare costs across AWS regions (Ohio and California) to inform deployment strategies.

## Architecture Overview

### Key Components

1. **Compute**:
   - Deployed EC2 instances (Linux-based, T-type configuration).
   - Integrated with Auto Scaling to adjust dynamically based on traffic.

2. **Database**:
   - Amazon RDS with MySQL engine (M5 standard large instances).
   - Configured for high availability with automated backups.

3. **Caching**:
   - Amazon ElastiCache with Redis engine to reduce database load and improve response times.
   - Implemented data partitioning and replication for reliability.

4. **Networking**:
   - Created Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) for network isolation and security.
   - Included a Customer Gateway for secure entry points.

5. **Load Balancing**:
   - Classic Load Balancers with 10 GB capacity for traffic distribution across EC2 instances.
   - Replicated architecture into a secondary VPC for failover and redundancy.

6. **Redundancy**:
   - Dual VPC setup ("Cached Database" and "Replica") to ensure operational continuity.
   - Managed traffic between VPCs using load balancing for seamless failover.

## Cost Analysis

### Annual Costs by Region

| Region       | Compute ($/yr) | Networking ($/yr) | Database ($/yr) | Total ($/yr) | Total (3 Years) |
|--------------|----------------|--------------------|-----------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **US-EAST-2 (Ohio)**       | 2186.50        | 227.76             | 5729.04        | 8143.30         | 24429.90        |
| **US-WEST-1 (California)** | 2606.98        | 238.27             | 6605.04        | 9450.29         | 28350.87        |

- **Observations**:
  - Database costs are higher in California due to regional operational expenses.
  - Networking costs are marginally lower in California.

### Considerations
- Proximity to end users for latency optimization.
- Data residency requirements and compliance.
- Long-term cost efficiency and performance trade-offs.

## Services Utilized

### Core AWS Services
1. **Amazon EC2**:
   - Elastic compute instances for scalable and reliable application hosting.
   - Configured with Auto Scaling to handle varying traffic loads.

2. **Amazon RDS**:
   - Managed database service with automated backups and high availability.

3. **Amazon ElastiCache**:
   - In-memory data caching with Redis to improve application response times.

4. **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**:
   - Classic Load Balancer for distributing traffic and ensuring fault tolerance.

5. **Amazon VPC**:
   - Virtual Private Cloud for secure networking and isolation.

### Supporting AWS Services
- **Customer Gateway** for secure access.
- **Region-based deployment** to ensure redundancy.

## Deployment Highlights

- **Primary Region**: US-EAST-2 (Ohio).
- **Secondary Region**: US-WEST-1 (California) for failover.
- **Secure Design**:
  - Data routed through the Customer Gateway before reaching the database.
  - Isolated environments using VPCs.

- **Redundancy**:
  - Secondary VPC ensures uninterrupted service in case of failure in the primary region.

- **Performance**:
  - Caching with ElastiCache significantly reduces database query load.
  - Load balancing evenly distributes traffic, preventing bottlenecks.

## Future Recommendations

1. **Monitor Usage**:
   - Utilize AWS CloudWatch for real-time monitoring and alerting.
   - Adjust scaling policies based on traffic patterns.

2. **Optimize Costs**:
   - Explore reserved instances or savings plans for long-term usage.

3. **Expand Services**:
   - Integrate Amazon Managed Blockchain for future business needs, such as secure transaction tracking.

4. **Continuous Testing**:
   - Regularly test failover systems to ensure seamless transitions during outages.
